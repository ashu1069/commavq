"""
Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) implementation.

ANS is an alternative to arithmetic coding that is:
- Faster (uses table lookups instead of arithmetic)
- Equally optimal in compression efficiency
- Used in modern compressors like zstd, LZFSE

TODO: Implement if you want to try ANS instead of arithmetic coding.
